Setup the database and stuff, with username and databasename from dbinfo.php. I'm working on doing this automaticly on migrate, but I can't get it to work.

To begin with, you need to go to localhost/migrate.php
Then, head over to index.php

From there on, this application is easy to use, and much self-explanatory.


Here are some login-details to use:

Admin user
Username: admin
Password: 123

Ordinary user
Username: kolloen
Password: 123
